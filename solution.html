            <h2>My Solution</h2>
            <p>To solve the problem of the ever-growing food demand,<br>
                the problem must be solved from multiple fronts.
            <h2>Where the focus needs to be:</h2>         
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 50pt">One of the first steps towards effectively feeding the world's population is <strong style="color: skyblue"> changing<br>
                     its dieting habits. </strong> According to Kyle Davis, if crop production is lower than the demand <br>
                     level, a volumetric diet increase would be at fault. Davis also mentions that anywhere from <br>
                     1.8-3.1 billion additional people can be fed from a change in dieting changes alone. 
                </li>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 50pt"><strong style="color: skyblue">Maximization of crop yield </strong> is the most advantageous way to provide food to ten billion people. <br>
                    One of the current solutions for a greater crop yield is the use of GMO crops. Currently, GMOs create <br>
                    a 22% increase in crop yield. To increase the effect of GMOs, it is necessary for the world to <br>
                    research and develop more advanced GMOs. 
                </li>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 30pt">
                    One third of all food produced is wasted through the current <strong style="color: skyblue">food supply chain </strong>according to the <br>
                     Food and Agricultural Organization. At every link in the chain, there is evidence of food waste. <br>
                     These weak links in the food supply chain must be targeted and eliminated. 
                </li>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 80pt">The UK government has made multiple recommendations as to how ten billion will be fed. Their point <br>
                    which was stressed the most is <strong style="color: skyblue">sustainability of crops into the future.</strong> While certain crops might <br>
                    survive in today's climate, they may not in tomorrow's. Dr. Richards states that in the future, pests<br>
                     and diseases that affect crop yield are constantly evolving to resist the pesticides and GMOs that <br>
                     are used by farmers.
